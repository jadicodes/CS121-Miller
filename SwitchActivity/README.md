# Switch Statements
In this activity, using a switch statement, I was tasked to ask the user to enter one item from
at least a list of four and then print out some property of the item. Use one of the examples below
or one of your own. I chose to use Hogwarts houses and their descriptors.

The most challenging aspect of this project was figuring out the benefits of switch statements over normal conditionals.
