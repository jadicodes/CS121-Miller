# Conditionals
This package contains two classes. EvenOrOdd asks user for a number and then determines whether it is even or odd. Login asks user for username and password and compares it to the correct answers to determine if the user has typed in the matching username, password, or both.

This conditionals activity was one of the first Java projects I had ever worked on. While it's very simple, it was challenging to adapt to the stricter script style after
doing all of my work in Python.
