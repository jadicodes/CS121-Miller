# Set and Iterator Activity
This set and iterator activity allows the user to choose how many students they would like to add to a set, give names to those students, and then will display
the set to the user using an Iterator.

Using the Java imports in this activity was a challenge, as I had never done anything like it in Python. It gave me insight into their usefulness.
