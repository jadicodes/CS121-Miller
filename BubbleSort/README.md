# Bubble Sort
This is a bubble sort algorithm that sorts integers inputted by the user.

Since this was the first sorting algorithm I had ever coded, the hardest part was definitely understanding what the bubble sort was doing algorithmically
before ever typing a line of code. I had several drawings on paper trying to figure it out.
