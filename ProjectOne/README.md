# Project 1
In this project, I was tasked to make a Pokemon battle game that only uses text. To do this, I had to solidify my understanding of conditionals.

Funnily enough, the most difficult part of this was keeping track of my open and closed brackets. Since there were so many, and many of them were within other conditionals,
I lost track of my brackets a lot in this project. It trained me to have a sharper eye for it and pushed me to improve my code format.
