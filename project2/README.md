# Project 2
In Project 2, I was tasked to make a program that lets two players create Pokemon of their own only using text. While this seems on the surface less impressive than project 1,
since there is no battling taking place, I actually found it much harder.

The most challenging part of this process was forcing myself to not only use constructors, but to actually grasp what they do.
